    "The Nizhnesvirsky lower bay is a vital part of a river system characterized by a dynamic freeze-thaw cycle. Understanding the extent of ice coverage and open water in this region is crucial for various applications, including navigation, ecosystem monitoring, and climate research. In this Jupyter notebook, we will leverage satellite imagery from the Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW) product, along with remote sensing principles, to classify ice and open water over a period of 8 months, from September 2022 to May 2023.\n",

The Sentinel-1 IW product provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which is unaffected by weather conditions, daylight, or cloud cover. SAR data measures the backscattered electromagnetic waves, allowing us to distinguish between different surface types."

    "Credentials for Sentinel Hub services are automatically injected as environment variables. It is therefore easy to populate Sentinel Hub's credential manager with the values. To obtain your `client_id` & `client_secret` you need to navigate to your [Dashboard](https://shapps.dataspace.copernicus.eu/dashboard/#/). In the User Settings you can create a new OAuth Client to generate these credentials. For more detailed instructions, visit the relevent [documentation page](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/SentinelHub/Overview/Authentication.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have your `client_id` & `client_secret`, it is recommended to configure a new profile in your Sentinel Hub Python package. Instructions on how to configure your Sentinel Hub Python package can be found [here](https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure.html). Using these instructions you can create a profile specific to using the package for accessing Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem data collections. This is useful as changes to the the config class are usually only temporary in your notebook and by saving the configuration to your profile you won't need to generate new credentials or overwrite/change the default profile each time you rerun or write a new Jupyter Notebook. \n",
