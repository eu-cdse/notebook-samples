Using these instructions you can create a profile specific to using the package for accessing Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem data collections. This is useful as changes to the the config class are usually only temporary in your notebook and by saving the configuration to your profile you won't need to generate new credentials or overwrite/change the default profile each time you rerun or write a new Jupyter Notebook. \n",
